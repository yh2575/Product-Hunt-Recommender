# Product-Hunt-Recommender
Recommendation systems use a number of different technologies. We can
classify these systems into two broad groups.
• Content-based systems examine properties of the items recommended. For
instance, if a Netflix user has watched many cowboy movies, then recom-
mend a movie classified in the database as having the “cowboy” genre.
• Collaborative filtering systems recommend items based on similarity mea-
sures between users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are
those preferred by similar users.
